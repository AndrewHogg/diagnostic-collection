# Specify the hostnames or IP addresses of the nodes the collector should run against.
# Each hostname or IP address (or docker container ID or k8s pod name) entry should be on a separate line. e.g.

# node_01
# 172.16.33.12

# Using this file will not lead to discovery of other nodes in the cluster.

# Begin the node list on the next line below this block comment.
